# kde-mic-mute-improvement
 A small improvement for the mute button under KDE.

Simply select micmute.sh as a script in the shortcuts under KDE Plasma and set a hotkey.
You have a microphone shortcut that plays a different tone when muting than when unmuting.
Handy if you want to use the global mute function of KDE, but miss the notification tones of Discord or similar.
